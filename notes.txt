Note - find some way to manage tasks?

TODO:
	- way to edit node title (separate editor maybe?)
	- ability to add/delete nodes & edges (*)
		- click and drag moves node
		- command+click and drag creates an edge
		- for deleting a node or edge, add a popup confirming deletion
		- box selection of nodes(?)
	- add node button (plus sign, opens up a field for title of node)
	- lock selection while editing (so you can’t change node focus)

LONG(er) TERM:
	- animated transitions between nodes (slight zoom effect)
		- this way, possible to maintain spatial awareness of graph
		- includes switching text, some kind of delayed fade
	- create button for inserting links to text (search links by name, select, insert link)
	- clustering by group (could be in multiple groups)
	- Styling
		- highlight nodes and edges adjacent to selected node
		- highlight (different style) selected node
		- fade all others slightly (make less prominent somehow)

ISSUES:
	- won’t get indexed by search engines b/c no html (maybe iframes are the way to go)
	- need a way to fallback if javascript is disabled/slow (html version)

(*) Currently working on. Adding a node is working, but all objects are duplicated. Also the force simulation doesn’t work.
